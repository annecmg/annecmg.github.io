layout: template

Metagenomes represent the genetic content of community members in a specific environment and contain unprecedented information on the genetic variation that exists within all the community members. Our research focus is evolutionary (meta-)genomics, that is, the inference of population genetic processes in microorganisms from genomic and metagenomic data.
