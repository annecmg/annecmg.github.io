Metagenomes represent the genetic content of community members in a specific environment and contain unprecedented information on the genetic variation that exists within all the community members. Our research focus is evolutionary (meta-)genomics, that is, the inference of population genetic processes in microorganisms from genomic and metagenomic data.

## August 2021

* We are looking for a PhD student in plant virus genomics! Forward the announcement to suitable candidates and apply here: <https://www.academictransfer.com/en/303862/phd-position-virus-diversity-and-evolution-in-natural-plant-ecosystems/> Feel free to contact me for questions!

* The PhD project "Deciphering the soil microbiome for optimized intercropping" is funded by the plant science group at WUR. This will establish a novel a collaboration between [Stefan Geisen](https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Stefan-dr.-SA-Stefan-Geisen.htm) and me. The project is embedded in a larger consortium of young tenure trackers at WUR. Stay tuned!

## July 2021

* The PhD project "Virus diversity and genome evolution in natural plant ecosystems (V-GENE)" has been awarded funding by the graduate school EPS: <https://www.graduateschool-eps.info/3-projects-awarded-in-eps-wu-young-tenure-track-call/> Let's celebrate (now) and look for a candidate (after the holidays)!

* Nikolaos Vakirlis started as a postdoc at Kiel University on a project that I acquired during my time there. We will work in close colaboration. Welcome Nikos!
