Metagenomes represent the genetic content of all community members in a specific environment and contain unprecedented information on the genetic variation that exists within all the community members. Our research focuses on viral and microbial evolution. To this end, we develop and apply approaches (i) to reconstruct viruses from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data and (ii) to infer microbial population genetic processes from genomic and metagenomic data.
